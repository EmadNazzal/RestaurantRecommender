# React Standards

## Overview

We follow the [Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide] for React standards. The [JavaScript Standards] are also followed for JavaScript code within React projects. Only the key documentation formatting rules are listed below. Please refer to the guides for more detailed information.

## General Formatting Rules

### Comments

```jsx
// This is a comment.

/* This is also a comment. */

/*
* This is a multi-line comment.
*/

{/* This is a comment in JSX. */}
```

### Documentation Comments

- Documentation comments are written in JSDoc format.
- The JSDoc documentation can be found on the [JSDoc Website].
- The full JSDoc style guide can be found in the [JSDoc] section of the Google JavaScript Style Guide.

### TODO

- Mark todos and action items with `TODO`.
- Append the GitHub username in parentheses as with the format `TODO(username)`.
- Append action items after a colon as in `TODO: action item`.

```jsx
// TODO(johndoe): Refactor this code.
```
