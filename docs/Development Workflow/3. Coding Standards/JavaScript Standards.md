## Overview

We follow the [Google JavaScript Style Guide] and the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide] for JavaScript standards. Only the key documentation formatting rules are listed below. Please refer to the guides for more detailed information.

## General Formatting Rules

### Comments

#### Single-Line Comments

```javascript
// This is okay.

/* So is this. */
```

#### Block Comments

```javascript
/*
 * This is
 * okay.
 */

// And so
// is this.

/* This is fine, too. */
```

### Documentation Comments

- Documentation comments are written in JSDoc format.
- The JSDoc documentation can be found on the [JSDoc Website].
- The full JSDoc style guide can be found in the [JSDoc] section of the Google JavaScript Style Guide.

### TODO

- Mark todos and action items with `TODO`.
- Append the GitHub username in parentheses as with the format `TODO(username)`.
- Append action items after a colon as in `TODO: action item`.
